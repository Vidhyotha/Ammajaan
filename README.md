# Ammajaan
This project was made by me and a friend of mine, for our 11th and 12th grade project.
We used tkinter library in pyhton to make the GUI.
We used wikipedia library to pick random words and descriptions of those words from wikipedia as the items to sell on the app.
We used file manipulation in Python to store our items in a csv file, which the main program then imports and uses as a dictionary.
# Features
1. Working login page that saves a new user's details in a text file and checks for incorrect usernames and passwords.
2. "Klassics" frame which would select 10 random items and display them on the main page of the app as discounted apps.
3. Search bar with which you can search for the items or even words in the items' description .
4. Item page opens when you click on an item name in either the search results or Klassics. It shows the name, description and the prices of the items, from here you can select the quantity and add them to cart.
5. Cart page shows all of your selected items and their quantities is displayed. Here, you can delete specefic items from your cart, clear all items from your cart or press the "view bill" button to proceed.
6. Bill page shows the item name, quantity, price and total price of all the items in the cart. The buy button then congratulates you on your puchase and clears your cart
#Disclaimer
Please note that this program is just a design and these items are not on sale, and you cannot actually buy anything.
